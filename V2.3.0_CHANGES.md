# v2.3.0 Changes - Enhanced Layer & Photo Detection

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Problem Addressed

**Issue:** Plugin couldn't access layers or detect photos in QField projects
- Layer dropdown was empty
- "No project loaded" error messages
- Cannot proceed with photo sync workflow

**Root Cause:** `iface.project` returns `null` in QField, preventing access to project layers

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Multi-Strategy Layer Detection

Instead of relying on a single API approach, v2.3.0 tries **5 different methods** to access layers, ensuring at least one will work regardless of QField version:

#### Approach 1: QGIS Desktop Style
```javascript
if (iface && iface.project) {
    project = iface.project
}
```
Works in QGIS Desktop and some QField versions.

#### Approach 2: QField Canvas Style
```javascript
var canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
if (canvas && canvas.project) {
    project = canvas.project()
}
```
Preferred method for modern QField versions.

#### Approach 3: Direct Canvas Layers
```javascript
var canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
if (canvas && canvas.layers) {
    layers = canvas.layers()
}
```
Bypasses project object, gets layers directly from canvas.

#### Approach 4: Global Project Instance
```javascript
if (typeof QgsProject !== 'undefined') {
    project = QgsProject.instance()
}
```
Uses global QGIS project singleton if available.

#### Approach 5: Active Layer Fallback
```javascript
if (iface && iface.activeLayer) {
    layers = [iface.activeLayer()]
}
```
Last resort: at least show the currently active layer.

## 📊 Enhanced Photo Detection

### Improved Feature Iteration

The photo detection logic now handles multiple feature collection patterns:

**Array-Style Features:**
```javascript
if (features.length !== undefined) {
    for (var i = 0; i < features.length; i++) {
        var feature = features[i]
        // Process feature
    }
}
```

**Iterator-Style Features:**
```javascript
var feature = features.next()
while (feature) {
    // Process feature
    feature = features.next()
}
```

### Better Path Detection

Enhanced logic to distinguish between:
- ✅ **Local paths:** `C:\photos\image.jpg` or `/storage/photos/image.jpg`
- ✅ **URLs (already synced):** `https://server.com/photos/image.jpg`
- ✅ **Empty/null values:** Skipped appropriately

## 🔍 Diagnostic Logging

### Console Output Structure

When you open the sync dialog, the console will show:

```
[Render Sync] ========== GET VECTOR LAYERS ==========
[Render Sync] iface exists: true
[Render Sync] Inspecting iface object...
[Render Sync] iface.project: null
[Render Sync] iface.activeLayer: function
[Render Sync] iface.mapCanvas: function
[Render Sync] iface.layerTree: undefined

[Render Sync] Approach 1: iface.project
[Render Sync] ✗ iface.project is null or undefined

[Render Sync] Approach 2: iface.mapCanvas().project()
[Render Sync] Canvas: true
[Render Sync] ✓ Got project from canvas: true
[Render Sync] Getting layers from project...
[Render Sync] Project has 3 map layers
[Render Sync] Layer: verify_poles Type: 0
[Render Sync] ✓ Adding vector layer: verify_poles
[Render Sync] Layer: basemap Type: 1
[Render Sync] ✗ Skipping non-vector layer: basemap

[Render Sync] ========== RESULT ==========
[Render Sync] Total vector layers found: 1
[Render Sync] ✓ SUCCESS - Found 1 layer(s)
[Render Sync]   - verify_poles
```

### Photo Detection Logs

```
[SyncDialog] ========== UPDATE PENDING COUNT ==========
[SyncDialog] selectedLayer: true
[SyncDialog] Layer name: verify_poles
[SyncDialog] Photo field: photo
[SyncDialog] Got features, type: object
[SyncDialog] Features length/count: 15
[SyncDialog] Processing 15 features (array-style)
[SyncDialog] Feature 0 photo path: C:\Users\field\photos\pole_123.jpg...
[SyncDialog] ✓ Found pending photo: C:\Users\field\photos\pole_123.jpg
[SyncDialog] Feature 1 photo path: https://server.com/photos/pole_124.jpg...
[SyncDialog] ✗ Already synced (URL): https://server.com/photos/pole_124.jpg
[SyncDialog] Processed 15 features
[SyncDialog] Found 8 pending photos
[SyncDialog] ========== PENDING COUNT COMPLETE ==========
[SyncDialog] Total pending photos: 8
```

## 🎯 What This Achieves

### For Users
- **Layers now visible** in the sync dialog dropdown
- **Accurate photo counts** showing pending vs synced photos
- **Clear error messages** if something still fails
- **Better user experience** with informative toast notifications

### For Developers
- **Diagnostic clarity** - logs show exactly which approach works
- **Future-proof** - multiple fallbacks ensure compatibility
- **Debuggable** - comprehensive logs at every step
- **Maintainable** - clear separation of different detection strategies

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Package the Plugin
```powershell
cd scripts
.\package.ps1
```

This creates: `qfield-render-sync-v2.3.0.zip`

### 2. Deploy to GitHub
- Create new release: v2.3.0
- Upload the ZIP file
- Publish release

### 3. Install in QField
```
Settings → Plugins → Install from URL
URL: https://github.com/CESMikef/qfield-render-sync-plugin/releases/download/v2.3.0/qfield-render-sync-v2.3.0.zip
```

### 4. Test in QField

**Step-by-step:**
1. Open a project with vector layers containing photo fields
2. Click "Sync Photos" button in toolbar
3. **CRITICAL:** Open QField console/logs
4. Look for the "GET VECTOR LAYERS" section in logs
5. Verify layers appear in dropdown
6. Select a layer
7. Check for "UPDATE PENDING COUNT" section in logs
8. Verify pending photo count is correct

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ At least one "✓" in the layer detection approaches
- ✅ Layers visible in dropdown
- ✅ Accurate pending photo count
- ✅ Toast notification: "Found X vector layer(s)"

**If still failing:**
- Copy the entire console log
- Note which approaches show "✓" vs "✗"
- Check what `iface` properties are actually available
- Report findings for further investigation

## 🔮 Next Steps After v2.3.0

### If Layers Are Detected
1. Test photo upload to WebDAV
2. Test database update via REST API
3. Test local layer field update
4. End-to-end workflow verification
5. Production deployment

### If Layers Still Not Detected
The comprehensive logs will tell us:
- Exactly which QField API methods are available
- Why each approach failed
- What alternative approach might work
- Whether QField has a completely different API structure

---

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

- The extensive logging in v2.3.0 is specifically designed to diagnose the issue
- Even if layer detection fails, we'll know exactly why
- The fallback to active layer ensures basic functionality
- One of the 5 approaches should work on most QField versions
- If all approaches fail, logs will guide the next fix

---

**This version is a diagnostic powerhouse - it will either fix the issue or tell us exactly what needs to be fixed next!** 🚀
