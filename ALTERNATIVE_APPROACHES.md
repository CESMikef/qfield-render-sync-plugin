# Alternative Approaches (Without Modifying QField)

## üéØ Goal
Upload photos from QField without modifying QField core or reading files in QML.

---

## Option 1: üåê Hybrid Approach - API Reads from WebDAV

### Concept
Instead of sending the file to the API, send the **file path** and have the API:
1. Download the file from a shared location (WebDAV/cloud)
2. Re-upload to final destination
3. Update database

### Architecture
```
QField ‚Üí Upload to WebDAV (works!) ‚Üí API reads from WebDAV ‚Üí Final destination
```

### How It Works

**Step 1:** QField uploads photo to temporary WebDAV location (using existing WebDAV widget)
```javascript
// QField has native WebDAV support through photo field widget
// Photos are automatically uploaded when captured
```

**Step 2:** Plugin tells API where to find the file
```javascript
// Instead of sending file content, send file URL
POST /api/v1/photos/process
{
    "global_id": "abc123",
    "photo_url": "https://webdav.server.com/temp/photo.jpg",
    "table": "verify_poles",
    "field": "photo"
}
```

**Step 3:** API downloads from WebDAV, processes, and updates DB
```python
# API side
@app.post("/api/v1/photos/process")
async def process_photo(data: PhotoProcessRequest):
    # Download from temporary WebDAV
    photo_data = download_from_webdav(data.photo_url)
    
    # Upload to final destination
    final_url = upload_to_final_webdav(photo_data)
    
    # Update database
    update_database(data.global_id, final_url, data.table, data.field)
    
    return {"success": True, "final_url": final_url}
```

### Pros
‚úÖ No QField modifications needed  
‚úÖ No file reading in QML  
‚úÖ Uses QField's native WebDAV support  
‚úÖ API has full file access  

### Cons
‚ùå Requires two WebDAV uploads (temp + final)  
‚ùå More complex API logic  
‚ùå Temporary storage needed  

---

## Option 2: üì± Use QField's Native Photo Widget

### Concept
Configure QField's photo field to upload directly to WebDAV, then just update the database.

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Configure QGIS project photo field with WebDAV path
```
Field Type: Attachment
Path: @project_home + '/photos/' + uuid() + '.jpg'
```

**Step 2:** QField automatically uploads when photo is captured
- QField's photo widget has native upload capability
- No plugin needed for upload!

**Step 3:** Plugin only updates database
```javascript
// Plugin just calls API to update DB record
POST /api/v1/photos/update-record
{
    "global_id": "abc123",
    "photo_url": "https://webdav.com/photos/abc123.jpg",
    "table": "verify_poles",
    "field": "photo"
}
```

### Pros
‚úÖ Uses QField's built-in functionality  
‚úÖ No file reading needed  
‚úÖ Simple plugin logic  
‚úÖ Reliable (uses native code)  

### Cons
‚ùå Requires proper QGIS project configuration  
‚ùå Limited control over upload process  
‚ùå May not work with all WebDAV servers  

---

## Option 3: üîå Use QField's Python Plugin Support

### Concept
QField supports Python plugins (via PyQGIS). Python has full file access.

### How It Works

**Create Python plugin instead of QML:**
```python
# qfield_photo_sync.py
from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QFile, QIODevice
import requests

class PhotoSyncPlugin:
    def upload_photo(self, local_path, api_url, token):
        # Python can read files!
        with open(local_path, 'rb') as f:
            files = {'file': f}
            data = {
                'global_id': global_id,
                'table': table,
                'field': field
            }
            headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
            
            response = requests.post(
                f'{api_url}/api/v1/photos/upload-and-update',
                files=files,
                data=data,
                headers=headers
            )
            
        return response.json()
```

### Pros
‚úÖ Python has full file access  
‚úÖ No QML restrictions  
‚úÖ Can use `requests` library  
‚úÖ More powerful than QML  

### Cons
‚ùå Need to check if QField supports Python plugins  
‚ùå Different development approach  
‚ùå May have deployment complexity

## Option 4: üîÑ Two-Stage Sync (Simplest!)

### Concept
Accept that QField handles upload, plugin only handles database sync.

### How It Works

**Stage 1:** User captures photo in QField
- QField uploads to WebDAV automatically (native feature)
- Photo field gets WebDAV URL

**Stage 2:** Plugin syncs database
- Plugin reads photo URLs (not files!)
- Calls API to update database records
- No file upload needed!

### Implementation

```javascript
// Plugin only needs to sync URLs to database
function syncPhotoRecords(features, apiUrl, token) {
    for (var feature of features) {
        var photoUrl = feature.attribute('photo');
        
        // Only sync if it's a WebDAV URL (already uploaded)
        if (photoUrl && photoUrl.startsWith('http')) {
            // Update database via API
            updateDatabase(feature.globalId, photoUrl, apiUrl, token);
        }
    }
}
```

### Pros
‚úÖ **Simplest approach**  
‚úÖ No file reading needed  
‚úÖ Uses QField's native upload  
‚úÖ Plugin just syncs metadata  
‚úÖ **This actually works!**  

### Cons
‚ùå Requires QField to be configured for WebDAV upload  
‚ùå Two separate steps (capture ‚Üí sync)  

---

## Option 5: üåâ Bridge Service on Device

### Concept
Run a local service on the device that has file access and acts as a bridge.

### Architecture
```
QField Plugin ‚Üí Local HTTP Service (localhost:8080) ‚Üí API
                      ‚Üì
                 Reads local files
```

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Run bridge service on device
```python
# bridge_service.py (runs on Android/iOS)
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    local_path = request.json['local_path']
    api_url = request.json['api_url']
    
    # Read file (we have access!)
    with open(local_path, 'rb') as f:
        files = {'file': f}
        response = requests.post(api_url, files=files)
    
    return response.json()

app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080)
```

**Step 2:** Plugin calls local service
```javascript
// Plugin calls localhost instead of remote API
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('POST', 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload');
xhr.send(JSON.stringify({
    local_path: photoPath,
    api_url: apiUrl
}));
```

### Pros
‚úÖ Bridge has file access  
‚úÖ Plugin doesn't need file access  
‚úÖ Flexible architecture  

### Cons
‚ùå Requires running service on device  
‚ùå Complex deployment  
‚ùå Battery/resource usage  
‚ùå Security concerns

## üéØ Recommended Approach: **Option 4 (Two-Stage Sync)**

This is the **simplest and most practical** solution:

### Implementation Plan

1. **Configure QField Project**
   - Set photo field to upload to WebDAV automatically
   - QField handles the file upload (native code)

2. **Simplify Plugin**
   - Remove file reading logic
   - Plugin only syncs photo URLs to database
   - Much simpler code!

3. **User Workflow**
   - Capture photo ‚Üí QField uploads automatically
   - Open plugin ‚Üí Sync database records
   - Done!

### Why This Works

- ‚úÖ **QField already does WebDAV upload** (native feature)
- ‚úÖ **No file reading needed** in plugin
- ‚úÖ **Simple API call** to update database
- ‚úÖ **Reliable** - uses QField's tested code
- ‚úÖ **Works today** - no waiting for QField changes

## üìã Comparison

| Approach | Complexity | File Access | Reliability | Time to Implement |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Option 1: API reads WebDAV** | Medium | Via API | Good | 2-3 days |
| **Option 2: Native widget** | Low | Via QField | Excellent | 1 day |
| **Option 3: Python plugin** | Medium | Yes | Good | 3-4 days |
| **Option 4: Two-stage** | **Low** | **Via QField** | **Excellent** | **1 day** |
| **Option 5: Bridge service** | High | Yes | Medium | 5+ days |

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

**I recommend Option 4** because:
1. It's the simplest
2. Uses QField's existing capabilities
3. Can be implemented immediately
4. Most reliable

Would you like me to implement Option 4?
