# 🔍 v2.3.1 - Toast Message Diagnostics (No Console Needed!)

## The Problem

You couldn't access QField console logs to see the diagnostic information from v2.3.0.

## The Solution

**v2.3.1 shows ALL diagnostic information in toast messages!**

No console access needed - you'll see everything on screen as toast notifications.

## 📱 What You'll See

When you click "Sync Photos", you'll see a series of toast messages showing:

### 1. Initial Diagnostic
```
🔍 Diagnostic: Checking layer access methods...
iface exists: YES
iface.project: NULL
iface.activeLayer: function
iface.mapCanvas: function
```

### 2. Each Approach Tested
```
Trying Approach 1: iface.project
✗ Approach 1 failed

Trying Approach 2: mapCanvas().project()
✓ Approach 2 SUCCESS!
```

### 3. Final Result
```
✅ SUCCESS! Found 1 layer(s): verify_poles
```

OR if all fail:

```
❌ ALL 5 APPROACHES FAILED
No project layers accessible. Do you have a project open?
```

---

## 📊 What Each Approach Tests

1. **Approach 1:** `iface.project` (QGIS Desktop style)
2. **Approach 2:** `iface.mapCanvas().project()` (QField canvas style)
3. **Approach 3:** `iface.mapCanvas().layers()` (Direct canvas access)
4. **Approach 4:** `QgsProject.instance()` (Global singleton)
5. **Approach 5:** `iface.activeLayer()` (Active layer fallback)

---

## 🎯 What to Report Back

### Take Screenshots of the Toast Messages!

1. **Screenshot 1:** The initial diagnostic showing iface properties
2. **Screenshot 2:** Each approach being tested (✓ or ✗)
3. **Screenshot 3:** The final result message

### Key Questions:

1. **Do you have a project open in QField?**
   - Can you see layers in the layer panel?
   - Are they vector layers?

2. **What does the initial diagnostic show?**
   - iface.project: NULL or EXISTS?
   - iface.mapCanvas: function or undefined?

3. **Which approach (if any) shows ✓ SUCCESS?**
   - Approach 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?
   - Or do all show ✗ failed?

4. **What's your QField version?**
   - Settings → About → Version number

---

## 💡 Expected Outcomes

### Best Case ✅
One of the approaches succeeds, layers appear in dropdown, ready to sync!

### Diagnostic Case 🔍
All approaches fail, but toast messages show exactly what's available:
- Which iface properties exist
- Which methods are available
- What returned null vs what threw errors

This tells us exactly what to try next!
