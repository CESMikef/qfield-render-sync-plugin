## üö´ Why Discontinued

**QML Security Restriction** prevents plugins from accessing local files for upload.

### Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
- QML/Qt restricts `XMLHttpRequest` from accessing local filesystem
- `file://` URLs are blocked in web contexts
- This is by design for security reasons
- No workaround exists within pure QML/JavaScript

**Impact:**
- Plugin cannot read photos from device storage
- Cannot upload files to WebDAV or API
- Cannot implement intended workflow

## üìä Development History

### Attempted Approaches

**v1.0 - v3.x: Direct WebDAV Upload**
- Attempted to read local files and upload to WebDAV
- **Result:** ‚ùå Failed - QML cannot access `file://` URLs

**v4.x: API-Based Upload**
- Attempted to send files to API endpoint
- **Result:** ‚ùå Failed - Same QML security restriction

**v5.0.0: Database Sync Only**
- Simplified to database updates only
- **Result:** ‚ùå Incomplete - Cannot determine which photos need syncing without file access

---

## üéØ Original Objective

Intended to provide:
- Automatic photo upload to WebDAV from QField
- PostgreSQL database updates via REST API
- Zero-configuration sync from mobile device

**Status:** Technically impossible within QField plugin architecture
